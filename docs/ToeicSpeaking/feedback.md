advantages of having a vacation in my country.

What’s the best time of year to go on vacation, and why?

I think that depends on where you go. I mean, if you go to a cold country it might be best to go in summer because it would be warmer, but if you visit a hot country you should go in winter because it might be cooler.

Have you ever tried an extreme sport? Why or why not?

Does mountain biking count?

Do you prefer to vacation in your country or abroad? Why?

It depends. I only really get one vacation from work each year, so I like to plan a nice vacation abroad for that time. I really love to get away
from it all and spend my days at the beach somewhere like Bali. I always get two traditional holidays: one over the Christmas break and New Year and one later in autumn for Thanksgiving weekend. Those are shorter, only a few days, so I prefer to either stay home or visit my family. So, I think it depends on which time.
